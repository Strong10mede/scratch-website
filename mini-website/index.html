            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the
                Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing
                a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
                network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may
                include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
                scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Eduction in India!</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">
                Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher absenteeism may have encouraged
                the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly in urban areas. Private schools
                divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools. Government ‘recognition’ is an official
                stamp of approval and for this a private school is required to fulfil a number of conditions, though
                hardly any private schools that get ‘recognition’ actually fulfil all the conditions of recognition. The
                emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary schools suggests that schools and parents do not take
                government recognition as a stamp of quality.[13]</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Javascript is here!</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),often abbreviated as JS, is a
                programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often
                just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97%
                of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
                Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for
                I/O.

                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other
                software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.

                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
                respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
